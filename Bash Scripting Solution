Step 1: Understand the Script
The provided script does the following:

Encrypt Function:

Converts each character in the input string to its ASCII value.
Adds a clock value (which changes with each character) to the ASCII value.
Converts the result back to a string and encodes the entire output as base64.
Decrypt Function:

Decodes the base64 string back to ASCII values.
Subtracts the clock value from each ASCII value to retrieve the original characters.
Step 2: Test the Script
Given the example in the screenshot, the script works as intended. Here is how you can recreate this process and understand each part.

Step 3: Run the Script
Create the Script:

Copy the script provided and save it to a file, e.g., penguincipher.sh.
Make the script executable with:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x penguincipher.sh
Encrypt a Message:

Run the script with a message:
bash
Copy code
./penguincipher.sh "The Far Side Gallery returns!"
This will output an encrypted string.
Decrypt the Message:

Run the script with the --decode flag:
bash
Copy code
./penguincipher.sh --decode "YourEncryptedStringHere"
Replace YourEncryptedStringHere with the actual encrypted string from the previous step.
This should output the original message: "The Far Side Gallery returns!"
Step 4: Walk Through the Script
Here is a breakdown of each section of the script:

Set Clock:

The setClock function calculates a clock value that changes with each character based on the length of the message. This ensures that each character is altered differently.
bash
Copy code
setClock() {
  MESSAGE_LENGTH="$1"
  CLOCK_INTERVAL=$(echo "$MESSAGE_LENGTH"*4 | bc -l)
  MAX_CLOCK_VALUE=$(echo "$MESSAGE_LENGTH"*25 | bc -l)
  CLOCK_VALUE=$(($CLOCK_INTERVAL + $CLOCK_VALUE))
  if [[ $CLOCK_VALUE -gt $MAX_CLOCK_VALUE ]]; then
    CLOCK_VALUE=$(($CLOCK_VALUE - $MAX_CLOCK_VALUE))
  fi
}
Encrypt:

Converts each character into its ASCII code, adds the clock value, and then converts it back to a string.
The result is encoded in base64 for easy handling.
bash
Copy code
encrypt() {
  TO_ENCRYPT="$1"
  ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE=""
  for (( i=0; i<"${#TO_ENCRYPT}"; i++ )); do
    setClock "${#TO_ENCRYPT}"
    CHAR="${TO_ENCRYPT:$i:1}"
    LC_CTYPE=C BYTE=$(printf "%d" "'$CHAR")
    ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE+="$(($BYTE + $CLOCK_VALUE)) "
  done
  RESULT=$(echo -n "$ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE" | base64 -w 0)
  echo "$RESULT"
}
Decrypt:

Reverses the encryption by subtracting the clock value from each ASCII code and converting it back to characters.
bash
Copy code
decrypt() {
  TO_DECRYPT=$(echo -n "$1" | base64 --decode)
  DECRYPTED_MESSAGE=""
  for OBFUSCATED_BYTE in $TO_DECRYPT; do
    setClock "$(echo "$TO_DECRYPT" | wc -w)"
    BYTE="$(($OBFUSCATED_BYTE - $CLOCK_VALUE))"
    printf "\x$(printf %x $BYTE)"
  done
}
Main Execution:

Checks if the script is being run to encrypt or decrypt based on the --decode flag.
bash
Copy code
if [[ "$1" == "--decode" ]]; then
  decrypt "$2"
else
  encrypt "'$1'"
fi
Step 5: Summary of the Process
Create the Script: Save the provided Bash code to a file.
Make it Executable: Use chmod +x to make it executable.
Encrypt a Message: Run the script with a message to encrypt.
Decrypt the Message: Use the --decode flag with the encrypted output to retrieve the original message.
